# Contact Card (GitHub Pages)

This repository hosts a simple, mobile-friendly contact page and downloadable vCard (.vcf).

## Quick Publish (GitHub Pages)

1. **Create a new public repo** on GitHub (e.g., `contact`).
2. **Upload** these files to the repo root: `index.html` and `steven-hand.vcf`.
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**:
   - Set **Source** to `Deploy from a branch`.
   - Choose **Branch**: `main` and **Folder**: `/ (root)` → **Save**.
4. Wait ~1–2 minutes. Your site will be live at:
   - `https://<YOUR_USERNAME>.github.io/<REPO_NAME>/`
5. Test the **Download vCard** button on a phone.

## QR Code (after publishing)

Once you know your final URL, create a QR code that points to your **live page** or directly to the `.vcf` file. If you share your final URL, I can generate a high-res PNG/SVG QR code for you.

## Customization

- Update contact details in `index.html` and `steven-hand.vcf` if needed.
- Optionally rename the repo to `yourusername.github.io` to host at the root domain (no repo path).

## Notes

- GitHub Pages is free for public repositories.
- iOS and Android both recognize `.vcf` files and offer to add a new contact.
